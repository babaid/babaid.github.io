Plug-and-play Astro blogging experience. \n2. Emphasis on customization and modularity. \n3. Visual parity between backend and frontend.\n\n## Theme\n\nFor out-of-the-box customization, [Oxygen](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-oxygen) theme is used, based on the [Minimal theme system](https://minimal.guide/home). It uses a slick color scheme that's highly customizable. \n\nThe [Oxygen Theme Settings](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-oxygen-settings), [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider), and [Style Settings](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings) community plugins are also installed by default, giving you complete control over your experience. You can even define your own color scheme presets and tweak just about anything.\n\n## CSS Snippets\n\n`astro-modular-styling` gives embedded HTML elements a similar look to how the theme handles them on the front end, for example form and button styling.\n\n> [!tip]- Tip: Optional CSS Snippets\n> An optional custom CSS snippet called `custom-draggable-top-area.css` makes moving your window is easier when the window frame is hidden and there's no tab bar. There are also versions specific to Windows and Mac that have OS-specific UI offsets, or just use the base version for no offsets. All can be configured in Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets. None of these are active in mobile.\n> \n> `hide-properties-heading-and-add-properties-button.css` is included if you'd rather use a CSS snippet instead of the Style Settings plugin, mentioned later in this post.\n> \n> `hide-tabs-icon-mobile.css` removes the tabs icon in the mobile version of Obsidian. If you enable the Disable Tabs plugin, you may want to enable this snippet as well.\n> \n> Both `hide-longpress-flair-mobile.css` and `hide-header-title-mobile.css` are also related to making the mobile interface more simple. Enable any of these snippets to hide these elements.\n\n## Important Hotkeys\n\nHere's a guide for some important hotkeys set especially for this theme:\n- Toggle left side panel: `CTRL + ALT + Z`\n- Toggle right side panel: `CTRL + ALT + X`\n- Toggle tab bar: `CTRL + ALT + S`\n- Navigate back: `ALT + ←`\n- Navigate forward: `ALT + →`\n- Open homepage: `CTRL + M` \n- Add a new property: `CTRL + ;`\n- Toggle property visibility for current note: `CTRL + ALT + P`\n- Toggle reading view: `CTRL + E`\n- Toggle Zen mode: `CTRL + SHIFT + Z`\n- Insert image: `CTRL + '`\n- Insert image into property: `CTRL + SHIFT + '`\n- Insert callout: `CTRL + SHIFT + C`\n- Rename current note: `CTRL + R` \n- Open SEO audit: `CTRL + SHIFT + A`\n- Open Terminal: `CTRL + SHIFT + D`\n- Open Astro Modular Settings: `CTRL + SHIFT + ,`\n- Git: Commit and Sync `CTRL + SHIFT + S`\n\nIf you're on Mac, `CTRL` = `CMD`.\n\n## Plugins \n\nDisabled default core plugins: \n- Canvas\n- Daily notes\n- Note composer\n- Page preview\n- Templates\n- Sync\n\nCommunity plugins enabled: \n- Alias Filename History\n- Astro Composer\n- Astro Modular Settings\n- Default New Tab Page\n- Git\n- Hider\n- Homepage\n- Image Inserter\n- Oxygen Theme Settings\n- Paste image into property\n- Paste image rename\n- Property Over Filename\n- ProZen\n- SEO\n- Style Settings\n- Title-Only Tab\n\n### Astro Modular Settings and Commander\n\nThe Astro Modular Settings plugin was specifically made for this theme. It has everything you need to easily tweak your blog's features. It edits the project's `config.ts` file, even though it's outside of the Obsidian vault's root directory. \n\nA wizard will open at startup which will lead you through some configuration options. You can disable this pop up if you like. \n\nPretty much anything else you'd possible want to customize is in the settings of the plugin. You can also create your own theme, import and export configs, and a bunch more.\n\nIt also has several useful commands. To open terminal quickly, use the `Open terminal` command. It's been modified for Windows, macOS, and Linux to start terminal in the relevant directory so you can easily do standard package manager commands with `pnpm` or `npm`. It can be activated with `CTRL + SHIFT + D`. \n\nYou can quickly configure your site settings with the `Open Astro Modular Settings` command. You can also press `CTRL + SHIFT + ,` to open it. \n\nThe Commander plugin helps us place a button for each of these actions on the file explorer UI. If you don't want them there, simply disable the plugin or customize the clickable icons to be somewhere else in Obsidian's interface.\n\n### Astro Composer and Alias Filename History\n\nHandy for easily creating new notes as Astro blog posts, pages, projects, or docs. Just create a new note with `CTRL + N`, type in a title in Title case or with special characters, and the note or folder name generated is a kebab-case version of the title without special characters. This is ideal for automating content page slugs. \n\nYou can also define and set default properties that can be generated automatically or manually set for any open note as well. The \"Standardize properties\" command can help set or reorganize any missing properties or tags, especially if you update your properties template down the road.\n\nUnlike other themes, you can use wikilinks or standard markdown links, ***without*** having to convert those to internal links for Astro with the \"Convert internal links for Astro\" command. This theme supports any internal link that works with Obsidian.\n\nYou can also easily grab links to headings by right clicking one and selecting \"Copy Heading Link\". \n\n`CTRL + R` allows you to easily rename blog posts, and note filenames (or parent folders) get updated in kebab-case automatically. When this happens, the old filename will be stored as an alias by default via the Alias Filename History plugin. This means redirects of the old post or page URL will go to the current post's slug, which is configured in Astro. \n\nYou can adjust lots of settings including regex for ignoring names (like `Untitled` or a `_` prefix), timeout in seconds to store the name, or looking for changes in the parent folder name as well if you use the folder-based post option.\n\n### Homepage and Default New Tab Page\n\nBoth of these work together so you're default screen is a `.base` file that's a directory of all of your blog posts, listed in reverse-chronological order. You're able to customize the note properties and views to your liking. \n\nI call this \"Home Base.\"\n\n```base\nfilters:\n  and:\n    - file.ext == \"md\"\nformulas:\n  Slug: |-\n    if(file.folder == \"posts\", \"/posts/\" + file.name.replace(\".md\", \"\"), \n      if(file.folder == \"pages\", \"/\" + file.name.replace(\".md\", \"\"), \n        if(file.folder == \"special\", if(file.name.replace(\".md\", \"\") == \"home\", \"/\", \"/\" + file.name.replace(\".md\", \"\")), \n          if(file.folder == \"projects\", \"/projects/\" + file.name.replace(\".md\", \"\"), \n            if(file.folder == \"docs\", \"/docs/\" + file.name.replace(\".md\", \"\"), \n              \"/\" + file.folder)))))\n  Content Folder: |-\n    if(file.name == \"index\",\n      if(file.folder != \"\",\n        if(file.folder.replace(\"/\" + file.folder.replace(/.*\\//, \"\"), \"\") != \"\",\n          file.folder.replace(\"/\" + file.folder.replace(/.*\\//, \"\"), \"\"),\n          file.folder\n        ),\n        \"root\"\n      ),\n      if(file.folder != \"\",\n        file.folder,\n        \"root\"\n      )\n    )\nproperties:\n  note.title:\n    displayName: Title\n  note.date:\n    displayName: Date\n  note.pubDate:\n    displayName: Date\n  formula.Slug:\n    displayName: Path\nviews:\n  - type: cards\n    name: Posts\n    limit: 8\n    filters:\n      and:\n        - file.folder.startsWith(\"posts\")\n    order:\n      - title\n      - formula.Slug\n      - date\n    sort:\n      - property: date\n        direction: DESC\n    cardSize: 230\n    image: note.image\n    imageAspectRatio: 0.55\n    columnSize:\n      note.title: 235\n  - type: cards\n    name: Standard Pages\n    filters:\n      and:\n        - file.folder.startsWith(\"pages\")\n    order:\n      - title\n      - formula.Slug\n    sort:\n      - property: title\n        direction: ASC\n  - type: cards\n    name: Special Pages\n    filters:\n      and:\n        - file.folder.startsWith(\"special\")\n    order:\n      - title\n      - formula.Slug\n    sort:\n      - property: title\n        direction: ASC\n  - type: cards\n    name: Projects\n    filters:\n      and:\n        - file.folder.startsWith(\"projects\")\n    order:\n      - title\n      - formula.Slug\n    sort:\n      - property: date\n        direction: DESC\n    image: note.image\n    cardSize: 200\n    imageAspectRatio: 0.6\n  - type: cards\n    name: Documentation\n    filters:\n      and:\n        - file.folder.startsWith(\"docs\")\n    order:\n      - title\n      - formula.Slug\n    sort:\n      - property: lastModified\n        direction: DESC\n    image: note.image\n    imageAspectRatio: 0.8\n  - type: cards\n    name: All Content\n    order:\n      - title\n      - formula.Slug\n    sort:\n      - property: file.folder\n        direction: ASC\n    cardSize: 230\n    image: note.image\n    imageAspectRatio: 0.55\n\n```\n\n### Oxygen Theme Settings, Hider, and Style Settings\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these plugins keep you focused and distraction-free while allowing for customization of your experience. \n\nShould you desire to hide any of the panels, you can use `CTRL + ALT Z` for the left side panel, `CTRL + ALT + X` for the right side panel, or `CTRL + ALT + S` for the tab bar. Pressing it again will reveal it again. \n\nIn Style Settings, the only options that have been modified are hiding the Properties heading and the \"Add Property\" button. If you prefer, you disable this plugin and use the `hide-properties-heading-and-add-properties-button.css` CSS snippet.\n\n### Paste Image Rename and Paste Image Into Property\n\nQuickly drag and drop image files or paste directly from your clipboard and give them kebab-case, SEO-friendly names. Both work directly in note content or within properties.\n\n### Image Inserter\n\nPull in images from Unsplash or other sources easily with just a few keystrokes. Just use `CTRL + '` to insert an image - and immediately set a SEO-friendly filename for it via the Paste Image Rename plugin. Insert into the designated property with `CTRL + SHIFT + '`\n\n### Title-Only Tab\n\nPulls from the `title` property instead of using the filename for any tab. \n\n### Property Over Filename\n\nWhen linking or searching notes, you can use the `title` property as its primary identifier, which is more helpful visually and semantically for linking between and searching for content, since note filenames are post/page slugs in kebab case instead of titles. \n\nWhen you link to another note, its `title` is automatically set as the hyperlinked text, but you can easily change it to something else after it's been inserted.\n\n### ProZen\n\nZen mode offers another quick option to focus on your writing. Pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + Z` will enter Zen mode: automatic full-screen, all elements removed except for your content. Then use `ESC` to exit. \n\nThis plugin is a great alternative if you don't prefer to use Hider to remove the UI, and prefer to toggle it all on or off at once as needed. Alternatively, you can use the Focus Mode included in the Minimal theme.\n\n### SEO\n\nGet a snappy audit of your content for search engine rankings and AI parsing. You can get a quick snapshot of your whole vault or drill down into specific posts. \n\n### BRAT (Temporary)\n\nOnly used temporarily to load Alias Filename History, Astro Composer, Disable Tabs, SEO, and Property Over Filename plugins before they're available in the Obsidian plugin directory. Future versions of this vault will remove BRAT in favor of the official releases.\n\n### Git\n\nWith the [Git](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git) plugin, you can easily publish to your Astro blog without leaving Obsidian using `CTRL + SHIFT + S`. Simply enable the plugin and configure with git to turn it on.\n\n### Disable Tabs\n\nThis is off by default, but if enabled, opening any new tab replaces the current one only. Especially nice for when you're hiding the tab bar and don't want multiple tabs. If you enable this plugin, you'd probably want to use some of those optional CSS snippets mentioned above to make window management easier.\n\nWhen combined with the Homepage and New Default Tab plugins, `CTRL + T` and `CTRL + M` essentially do the same thing.\n\n### Shell Commands\n\nOff by default also, we used to use this to open the `config.ts` file and open the terminal in the project's root directory, but these functions have been replaced by Astro Modular Settings. You can re-enable it and use it though if it's useful to you.","src/content/posts/obsidian-vault-guide.md","c991e19a2df5e477",{"html":32,"metadata":33},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/posts/attachments/astro-composer-suite-for-obsidian.webp\" alt=\"Astro and Obsidian logos stacked vertically with a &#x22;+&#x22; (plus) sign between them.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"overview\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#overview\">Overview\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>All plugins, key bindings, and the theme can be customized to your liking, but this is what’s on by default.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"philosophy\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#philosophy\">Philosophy\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Plug-and-play Astro blogging experience.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Emphasis on customization and modularity.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Visual parity between backend and frontend.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"theme\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#theme\">Theme\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>For out-of-the-box customization, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-oxygen\">Oxygen\u003C/a> theme is used, based on the \u003Ca href=\"https://minimal.guide/home\">Minimal theme system\u003C/a>.

To open terminal quickly, use the \u003Ccode>Open terminal\u003C/code> command. It’s been modified for Windows, macOS, and Linux to start terminal in the relevant directory so you can easily do standard package manager commands with \u003Ccode>pnpm\u003C/code> or \u003Ccode>npm\u003C/code>. It can be activated with \u003Ccode>CTRL + SHIFT + D\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can quickly configure your site settings with the \u003Ccode>Open Astro Modular Settings\u003C/code> command.

Just create a new note with \u003Ccode>CTRL + N\u003C/code>, type in a title in Title case or with special characters, and the note or folder name generated is a kebab-case version of the title without special characters. This is ideal for automating content page slugs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can also define and set default properties that can be generated automatically or manually set for any open note as well. The “Standardize properties” command can help set or reorganize any missing properties or tags, especially if you update your properties template down the road.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unlike other themes, you can use wikilinks or standard markdown links, \u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>without\u003C/strong>\u003C/em> having to convert those to internal links for Astro with the “Convert internal links for Astro” command.

All math works seamlessly in both light and dark themes.\n\n### Inline Math\n\nUse single dollar signs for inline math: $E = mc^2$ or $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta x+e^{-i\\theta}$.\n\n### Display Math\n\nUse double dollar signs for centered display math:\n\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\\\\nc & d\n\\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc\n$$\n\n$$\nf(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2\n$$\n\n### Common Mathematical Notation\n\n#### Fractions and Superscripts\n- Fractions: $\\frac{a}{b}$, $\\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1}$\n- Superscripts: $x^2$, $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$\n- Subscripts: $x_1$, $H_2O$\n\n#### Greek Letters\n- $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta, \\epsilon, \\theta, \\lambda, \\mu, \\pi, \\sigma, \\phi, \\omega$\n- $\\Gamma, \\Delta, \\Theta, \\Lambda, \\Pi, \\Sigma, \\Phi, \\Omega$\n\n#### Mathematical Symbols\n- Summation: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$\n- Product: $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i$\n- Integral: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}$\n- Limit: $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1$\n\n#### Matrices and Vectors\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nax + by \\\\\ncx + dy\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n#### Complex Equations\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\n\n$$\ni\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(\\vec{r},t) = \\hat{H}\\Psi(\\vec{r},t)\n$$\n\n### Math in Callouts\n\nMath works perfectly within callouts:\n\n> [!note] Mathematical Proof\n> The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle:\n> $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n> \n> Where $c$ is the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ are the other two sides.\n\n> [!tip] Integration by Parts\n> The formula for integration by parts is:\n> $$\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du$$\n> \n> This is particularly useful for integrals involving products of functions.\n\n### Advanced Mathematical Typesetting\n\n#### Aligned Equations\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nf(x) &= ax^2 + bx + c \\\\\nf'(x) &= 2ax + b \\\\\nf''(x) &= 2a\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n#### Cases and Piecewise Functions\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx^2 & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\\n-x^2 & \\text{if } x \u003C 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n#### Set Notation\n- Natural numbers: $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$\n- Real numbers: $\\mathbb{R}$\n- Complex numbers: $\\mathbb{C}$\n- Set union: $A \\cup B$\n- Set intersection: $A \\cap B$\n- Subset: $A \\subseteq B$\n\n### Math with Text\n\nYou can mix math with regular text seamlessly. For example, the quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{1}{2}$, which gives us the roots of any quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n\n### Obsidian Compatibility\n\nAll math notation works identically in Obsidian and your published blog:\n\n- **Inline math**: `$...$` syntax\n- **Display math**: `$$...$$` syntax  \n- **LaTeX commands**: Full support for standard LaTeX math commands\n- **Greek letters**: Use `\\alpha`, `\\beta`, etc.\n- **Symbols**: Use `\\sum`, `\\int`, `\\infty`, etc. \n\n## Diagrams\n\nThis section reproduces some Mermaid diagram examples for convenience. \n\n###

state:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Invalid syntax\n    B --> C\n    INVALID_COMMAND\n```\n\n### Theme Integration\n\nThe diagrams should automatically adapt to the current theme (light/dark) and use the theme colors for better integration with the overall design.\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nAll diagrams should be responsive and work well on mobile devices, with proper scaling and overflow handling.","src/content/posts/obsidian-embeds-demo.md","c2d855565389e1e5",{"html":151,"metadata":152},"\u003Ch2 id=\"media-embeds\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\"

Use it for general information that readers should be aware of.\n\n> [!tip] Tip\n> This is a tip callout. Perfect for helpful suggestions and best practices.\n\n> [!important] Important\n> This is an important callout.

Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)\n2. Run the installer with default settings\n3. Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and run `git --version`\n\n### macOS\n1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`\n2. Or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)\n3. Verify installation: Open Terminal and run `git --version`\n\n### Linux\n```bash\n# Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n\n# CentOS/RHEL\nsudo yum install git\n\n# Verify installation\ngit --version\n```\n\n## Step 2: Configure Git\n\nSet up your Git identity:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n```\n\n### Optional: Set up SSH keys for GitHub\n1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your.email@example.com\"`\n2. Add to SSH agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`\n3. Copy public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`\n4. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key\n\n## Step 3: Install SourceTree\n\n### Download and Install\n1. Visit [sourcetreeapp.com](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)\n2. Download the free version\n3. Install with default settings\n4. Sign in with your Atlassian account (free)\n\n### First Launch Setup\n1. Choose \"I don't have a repository yet\"\n2. Connect your GitHub account\n3. Authorize SourceTree to access your repositories\n\n## Step 4: Initialize Your Blog Repository\n\n### Option A: Create New Repository on GitHub\n1. Go to GitHub.com → New Repository\n2. Name it `your-blog-name`\n3. Make it public or private\n4. Don't initialize with README (we'll do this locally)\n\n### Option B: Use Existing Repository\nIf you already have a repository, skip to Step 5.\n\n## Step 5: Clone Repository in SourceTree\n\n1. Open SourceTree\n2. Click \"Clone\" button\n3. Enter your repository URL:\n   - HTTPS: `https://github.com/username/your-blog-name.git`\n   - SSH: `git@github.com:username/your-blog-name.git`\n4. Choose local folder for your project\n5. Click \"Clone\"\n\n## Step 6: Set Up Your Astro Blog\n\n### Copy Your Blog Files\n1. Copy all your Astro Modular files into the cloned repository folder\n2. Ensure you have:\n   - `src/` directory with your content\n   - `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - `astro.config.mjs`\n   - All other necessary files\n\n### Initial Commit\n1. In SourceTree, you'll see all your files listed as \"Unstaged files\"\n2. Click \"Stage All\" to add all files to staging\n3. Write a commit message: \"Initial blog setup\"\n4. Click \"Commit\"\n5. Click \"Push\" to upload to GitHub\n\n## Step 7: Configure Deployment\n\n### For Netlify\n1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)\n2. Connect your GitHub account\n3. Select your blog repository\n4. Build settings:\n   - Build command: `pnpm run build`\n   - Publish directory: `dist`\n5. Deploy!\n\n### For Vercel\n1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)\n2. Import your GitHub repository\n3. Framework preset: Astro\n4. Deploy!\n\n## Step 8: Daily Workflow with SourceTree\n\n### Making Changes\n1. Edit your blog content in Obsidian or your editor\n2. Open SourceTree\n3. Review changes in the \"Working Directory\" tab\n4. Stage specific files or \"Stage All\"\n5. Write descriptive commit message\n6. Click \"Commit\"\n7. Click \"Push\" to sync with GitHub\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Commit frequently**: Small, focused commits are better\n- **Write clear messages**: \"Add new blog post about X\" not \"Update files\"\n- **Pull before pushing**: Always pull latest changes first\n- **Use branches**: Create feature branches for major changes\n\n## Step 9: Advanced Git Workflows\n\n### Creating Branches\n1. In SourceTree, click \"Branch\" → \"New Branch\"\n2. Name it descriptively: `feature/new-theme` or `fix/typo-correction`\n3. Make your changes\n4. Commit and push the branch\n5. Create Pull Request on GitHub\n\n### Merging Changes\n1. Switch to main branch\n2. Pull latest changes\n3. Merge your feature branch\n4. Delete the feature branch\n\n### Resolving Conflicts\n1. SourceTree will show conflict markers\n2. Edit files to resolve conflicts\n3. Stage resolved files\n4. Commit the resolution\n\n## Step 10: Backup and Recovery\n\n### Regular Backups\n- Your code is automatically backed up on GitHub\n- Consider additional backups of your content\n- Use Git's built-in history for recovery\n\n### Recovering from Mistakes\n- **Undo last commit**: Right-click commit → \"Reset current branch to this commit\"\n- **Revert changes**: Right-click file → \"Discard changes\"\n- **View history**: Click on any commit to see what changed\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Authentication Problems\n- **HTTPS**: Use Personal Access Token instead of password\n- **SSH**: Ensure SSH key is added to GitHub account\n\n### Merge Conflicts\n- Don't panic! Conflicts are normal\n- Read the conflict markers carefully\n- When in doubt, ask for help\n\n### Large Files\n- Git isn't designed for large binary files\n- Use Git LFS for images and videos\n- Or store assets externally (CDN, etc.)\n\n### Repository Size\n- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files\n- Clean up history if repository becomes too large\n\n## Integration with Obsidian\n\n### Git Integration in Obsidian\n1. Install \"Obsidian Git\" plugin\n2. Configure auto-commit settings\n3. Your Obsidian vault changes will be automatically committed\n\n### Workflow\n1. Write in Obsidian\n2. Obsidian Git auto-commits changes\n3. SourceTree pulls and pushes to GitHub\n4. Netlify/Vercel auto-deploys\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you have Git and SourceTree set up:\n\n1. **Explore SourceTree features**: Learn about stashing, cherry-picking, and rebasing\n2. **Set up CI/CD**: Automate your deployment pipeline\n3. **Collaborate**: Invite others to contribute to your blog\n4. **Backup strategies**: Implement additional backup solutions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- **SourceTree Documentation**: [confluence.atlassian.com](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb)\n- **Git Documentation**: [git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc)\n- **GitHub Help**: [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com)\n\nRemember: Git and SourceTree are powerful tools that will make managing your blog much easier. Take time to learn the basics, and don't hesitate to experiment in a test repository first!","src/content/docs/sourcetree-and-git-setup/index.md","246da194e34bbf62",{"html":754,"metadata":755},"\u003Cp>This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up SourceTree and Git for

string;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Image Loading\n- **Lazy loading** for below-the-fold images\n- **Eager loading** for above-the-fold content\n- **WebP format priority** with fallbacks\n- **Responsive image generation** with multiple sizes\n- **Placeholder system** for missing images\n\n### Search Performance\n- **Debounced search input** to prevent excessive queries\n- **Cached search results** for repeated queries\n- **Fuse.js fuzzy search** integration for accurate results\n- **Virtual scrolling** for large result sets\n\n### Theme Performance\n- **CSS custom properties** for dynamic theming\n- **Theme caching** for graph components\n- **Lazy theme loading** for custom themes\n- **Optimized color calculations** for graph rendering\n\n### Mermaid Performance\n- **Intersection Observer** for lazy diagram loading\n- **Diagram caching** by source and theme\n- **Progressive loading** with skeleton states\n- **Memory management** with automatic cleanup\n\n### Graph Performance\n- **D3 force simulation** with optimized settings\n- **Node filtering** for local graph views\n- **Event cleanup** to prevent memory leaks\n- **Efficient rendering** with SVG optimization\n\n## Build Process\n\n### Asset Sync\n```typescript\n// Supported media types\nconst supportedMediaTypes = {\n  images: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp', 'svg', 'bmp', 'tiff', 'tif', 'ico'],\n  audio: ['mp3', 'wav', 'ogg', 'm4a', '3gp', 'flac', 'aac'],\n  video: ['mp4', 'webm', 'ogv', 'mov', 'mkv', 'avi'],\n  documents: ['pdf']\n};\n```\n\n### RSS and Atom Feeds\n- **Automatic generation** during build process\n- **Post filtering** (excludes drafts in production)\n- **Image support** with Open Graph integration\n- **Category mapping** from post tags\n- **Cache headers** for optimal performance\n\n### Deployment Platforms\n- **Netlify**: `netlify.toml` with redirects and build settings\n- **Vercel**: `vercel.json` with redirects and cache headers\n- **GitHub Pages**: `public/redirects.txt` for redirects\n\n## Development Tools\n\n### Scripts\n```bash\n# Development\npnpm run dev              # Start development server\npnpm run build            # Build for production\npnpm run check-images     # Check for missing images\npnpm run sync-images      # Sync images from content to public\npnpm run process-aliases  # Process content aliases\npnpm run generate-deployment-config # Generate deployment configs\n\n# Version management\npnpm run version          # Get current theme version\n```\n\n### Configuration Validation\n- **TypeScript interfaces** for all configuration options\n- **Runtime validation** for critical settings\n- **Helpful error messages** with suggestions\n- **Default fallbacks** for missing configuration\n\nThis API

minimal friction.\n\n## Prerequisites & Setup\n\nYou'll need:\n- **Node.js 18+**\n- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm\n- Basic markdown familiarity\n- Obsidian (optional)\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install pnpm\nnpm install -g pnpm\n\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Preview\npnpm dev # or pnpm preview\n# Available at http://localhost:5000\n\n# Build for production\npnpm build\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Core Settings\n\nConfigure everything in `src/config.ts`. The configuration is organized in sections:\n\n```typescript\nexport const siteConfig = {\n  site: 'https://yourdomain.com',\n  title: 'Your Blog Title',\n  description: 'Your blog description',\n  author: 'Your Name',  // Global author for all posts\n  language: 'en',\n}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\n### Theme & Layout\n\nSelect theme and layout options in the config:\n\n```typescript\n// Global Settings\ntheme: \"oxygen\",\ncustomThemeFile: \"custom\", \navailableThemes: \"all\", \nfonts: {\n  source: \"local\",\n  families: {\n    body: \"Inter\",\n    heading: \"Inter\",\n    mono: \"JetBrains Mono\", \n  },\n  display: \"swap\",\n},\nlayout: {\n  contentWidth: \"45rem\",\n},\ntableOfContents: {\n  enabled: true,        // Global TOC toggle for all posts\n  depth: 4,            // Maximum heading depth (2-6, where 2=H2, 3=H3, etc.)\n},\nfooter: {\n  enabled: true,\n  content: `© 2025 {author}. Built with Astro Modular.`,\n  showSocialIconsInFooter: true,\n},\nhideScrollBar: false,  // Hide browser scrollbar\nscrollToTop: true,     // Show scroll-to-top button\nfeatureButton: \"mode\", // \"mode\" | \"graph\" | \"theme\" | \"none\" - what the main feature button does\nseo: {\n  defaultOgImageAlt: \"Astro Modular logo.\",\n},\ndeployment: {\n  platform: \"netlify\", // \"netlify\" | \"vercel\" | \"github-pages\" - sets redirect configuration\n},\n```\n\nThe theme options are currently Oxygen, Minimal, Atom, Ayu, Catppuccin, Charcoal, Dracula, Everforest, Flexoki, Gruvbox, macOS, Nord, Obsidian, Rosé Pine, Sky, Solarized, Things, and Custom. Theme changes are visible in real-time with `pnpm dev`.\n\n### Custom Themes\n\nYou can create your own custom themes by:\n\n1. **Rename the template**: Rename `src/themes/custom/custom.ts` to whatever you want\n2. **Modify colors**: Update the color scales to match your design\n3. **Update config**: \n   - Set `theme: \"custom\"` in `src/config.ts`\n   - Set `customThemeFile: \"your-theme-name\"` (filename without .ts extension)\n4. **Test**: Use `pnpm dev` to see your theme changes in real-time\n\nThe system automatically finds and uses your custom theme!\n\nSee `src/themes/custom/README.md` for detailed instructions and best practices.\n\n### Font Configuration\n\nCustomize fonts for headings, body text, and code with flexible loading options:\n\n```typescript\nfonts: {\n  source: \"local\", // \"local\" for self-hosted fonts, \"cdn\" for Google Fonts CDN\n  families: {\n    body: \"Inter\",      // Body text font family\n    heading: \"Inter\",   // Heading font family  \n    mono: \"JetBrains Mono\", // Monospace font family\n  },\n  display: \"swap\", // Font loading strategy: \"swap\", \"fallback\", or \"optional\"\n}\n```\n\n**Font Loading Options:**\n- **Local fonts** (`source: \"local\"`): Self-hosted fonts for better performance and privacy\n- **CDN fonts** (`source: \"cdn\"`): Google Fonts CDN for unlimited font choices\n\n**Suggested Font Combinations:**\n- **Default**: `heading: \"Inter\"`, `body: \"Inter\"`, `mono: \"JetBrains Mono\"`\n- **Modern**: `heading: \"Montserrat\"`, `body: \"Lato\"`, `mono: \"Fira Code\"`\n- **Elegant**: `heading: \"Playfair Display\"`, `body: \"Source Sans Pro\"`, `mono: \"Source Code Pro\"`\n- **Serif**: `heading: \"Merriweather\"`, `body: \"Merriweather\"`, `mono: \"IBM Plex Mono\"`\n\n**Supported Fonts (Local Mode):**\n- **Sans-Serif**: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Poppins, Source Sans Pro, Nunito, Montserrat\n- **Serif**: Playfair Display, Merriweather, Lora, Crimson Text, PT Serif, Libre Baskerville\n- **Monospace**: Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, Source Code Pro, IBM Plex Mono, Cascadia Code\n\n**CDN Mode Benefits:**\n- Any Google Font works instantly\n- No package installation needed\n- Unlimited font choices\n\n**Local Mode Benefits:**\n- Better performance (no external requests)\n- Enhanced privacy (no tracking)\n- Works offline\n- Faster loading times\n\nThe system gracefully handles unsupported fonts by falling back to system fonts, ensuring your site never breaks.\n\n### Command Palette\n\nThe command palette provides instant navigation and search functionality:\n\n```typescript\ncommandPalette: {\n    enabled: true,\n    shortcut: \"ctrl+K\",\n    placeholder: \"Search posts\",\n    search: {\n      posts: true,\n      pages: false,\n      projects: false,\n      docs: false,\n    },\n    sections: {\n      quickActions: true,\n      pages: true,\n      social: true,\n    },\n    quickActions: {\n      enabled: true,        // Enable quick actions section\n      toggleMode: true,     // Show dark/light mode toggle\n      graphView: true,      // Show graph view button\n      changeTheme: true,    // Show theme switcher\n    },\n}\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- **Instant Search**: Press `Ctrl+K` (or a different shortcut you define) to search posts, pages, and projects\n- **Quick Actions**: Theme switching, navigation shortcuts\n- **Customizable**: Change shortcut, placeholder text, and enabled sections\n\n### Profile Picture\n\nAdd a personal touch with a configurable profile picture:\n\n```typescript\nprofilePicture: {\n  enabled: true,\n  image: \"/profile.jpg\",        // Path to your image (place in public/ directory)\n  alt: \"Profile picture\",       // Alt text for accessibility\n  size: \"md\",                   // \"sm\" (32px), \"md\" (48px), or \"lg\" (64px)\n  url: \"/about\",                // Optional URL to link to when clicked\n  placement: \"footer\",          // \"footer\" or \"header\"\n  style: \"circle\",              // \"circle\", \"square\", or \"none\"\n}\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- **Flexible Placement**: Header (replaces text logo) or Footer\n- **Multiple Styles**: Circle (profile photos), Square (logos), None (banners)\n- **Responsive**: Different layouts for mobile and desktop\n- **Theme-Aware**: Styling adapts to all available themes\n\n### Navigation Configuration\n\nCustomize your site's navigation menu and social links:\n\n```typescript\nnavigation: {\n  showNavigation: true,           // Show/hide main navigation\n  style: \"traditional\",           // \"minimal\" or \"traditional\" navigation style\n  showMobileMenu: true,           // Show mobile menu toggle\n  pages: [                        // Navigation menu items\n    { title: \"Posts\", url: \"/posts\" },\n    { title: \"Projects\", url: \"/projects\" },\n    { title: \"Docs\", url: \"/docs\" },\n    { title: \"About\", url: \"/about\" },\n  ],\n  social: [                       // Social media links\n    { title: \"GitHub\", url: \"https://github.com/username\", icon: \"github\" },\n    { title: \"X\", url: \"https://x.com/username\", icon: \"x-twitter\" },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Navigation Styles:**\n- **Traditional**: Full-sized text, center alignment\n- **Minimal**: Smaller text, right alignment\n\n### Homepage Configuration\n\nThe homepage content is controlled by the `homeOptions` section:\n\n- **Featured Post**: Show latest post or a specific featured post\n- **Recent Posts**: Display recent posts with configurable count\n- **Projects & Docs**: Show featured projects and documentation\n- **Home Blurb**: Control placement or disable completely\n\nWhen only one content type is enabled, it gets special treatment with centered \"View all\" links. When only the blurb is shown, it displays as a proper page with H1 title and rounded container styling.\n\n### Post Options\n\nConfigure post-related features in the `postOptions` section:\n\n```typescript\npostOptions: {\n  postsPerPage: 6,\n  readingTime: true,\n  wordCount: true,\n  tableOfContents: true,\n  tags: true,\n  linkedMentions: {\n    enabled: true,\n    linkedMentionsCompact: false,\n  },\n  graphView: {\n    enabled: true,\n    showInSidebar: true,\n    showInCommandPalette: true,  // Show graph button in command palette\n    maxNodes: 100,               // Maximum nodes to display\n    showOrphanedPosts: true,     // Show posts with no connections\n  },\n  postNavigation: true,\n  showPostCardCoverImages: \"featured-and-posts\",\n  postCardAspectRatio: \"og\",\n  customPostCardAspectRatio: \"2.5/1\",\n  comments: {\n    enabled: false,\n    provider: \"giscus\",\n    // ... other comment settings\n  },\n}\n```\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nEnabling table of contents is a global toggle for all posts. This is different from the other content types, like pages, which get a per-page TOC toggle via frontmatter.\n\n**Linked Mentions Features:**\n- `linkedMentions: true` - enable linked mentions section at the end of the page showing which posts reference the current post\n- `linkedMentionsCompact: false` - choose between detailed view (default) or compact view for linked mentions\n\n**Cover Image Options:**\n- `\"all\"` - show cover images on all post cards\n- `\"featured\"` - show only on the featured post section and featured posts\n- `\"home\"` - show only on homepage sections (featured and recent)\n- `\"posts\"` - show only on posts pages, tag pages, and post cards\n- `\"featured-and-posts\"` - show on featured post section AND posts pages/tags cards (but not recent posts section)\n- `\"none\"` - never show cover images on post cards\n\n**Note:** This setting only affects post cards. Project and documentation cards always show cover images when available.\n\n**Post Card Aspect Ratio:**\nConfigure the aspect ratio for post card cover images:\n\n```typescript\npostOptions: {\n  postCardAspectRatio: \"og\", // Default: OpenGraph standard\n  customPostCardAspectRatio: undefined, // For custom ratios\n}\n```\n\n**Aspect Ratio Options:**\n- `\"og\"` (1.91:1) - open graph standard (default)\n- `\"16:9\"` (1.78:1) - standard widescreen\n- `\"4:3\"` (1.33:1) - traditional\n- `\"3:2\"` (1.5:1) - classic photography\n- `\"square\"` (1:1) - square\n- `\"golden\"` (1.618:1) - golden ratio\n- `\"custom\"` - use your own ratio\n\n**Custom Aspect Ratio Example:**\n```typescript\npostOptions: {\n  postCardAspectRatio: \"custom\",\n  customPostCardAspectRatio: \"2.5/1\" // Custom 2.5:1 ratio\n}\n```\n\n*Note: This only affects post cards (listings, homepage, tag pages). Individual post cover images maintain their original aspect ratio.*\n\n### Comments System\n\nThe theme includes a Giscus-powered commenting system that uses GitHub Discussions. Here's how to set it up:\n\n#### Enable Comments\n\nIn your `src/config.ts`, enable comments:\n\n```typescript\npostOptions: {\n  comments: {\n    enabled: true,  // Enable/disable comments\n    // ... other comment settings\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### GitHub Setup\n\n1. **Enable Discussions on Your Repository**:\n   - Go to your GitHub repository\n   - Click **Settings** → **General**\n   - Scroll to **\"Features\"** section\n   - Check **\"Discussions\"** and click **\"Set up discussions\"**\n\n2. **Create a Discussion Category**:\n   - Go to **Discussions** tab in your repository\n   - Click **\"New category\"**\n   - Name it **\"General\"**\n   - Set format to **\"Announcement\"** (prevents random users from creating new discussions)\n   - Description: \"Comments on blog posts\"\n\n3. **Get Giscus Configuration**:\n   - Visit [giscus.app](https://giscus.app)\n   - Enter your repository: `username/repo-name`\n   - Select **\"General\"** as the discussion category\n   - Copy the generated **Repository ID** and **Category ID**\n\n1. **Update Your Config**:\n\n```typescript\npostOptions: {\n  comments: {\n    enabled: true,\n    provider: \"giscus\",\n    repo: \"username/repo-name\",        // Your GitHub repository\n    repoId: \"R_kgDO...\",              // Repository ID from Giscus\n    category: \"General\",               // Discussion category\n    categoryId: \"DIC_kwDO...\",        // Category ID from Giscus\n    mapping: \"pathname\",               // How posts map to discussions\n    strict: \"0\",                      // Allow comments on any post\n    reactions: \"1\",                   // Enable reactions\n    metadata: \"0\",                    // Hide discussion metadata\n    inputPosition: \"bottom\",          // Comment input position\n    theme: \"preferred_color_scheme\",  // Follows user's theme preference\n    lang: \"en\",                       // Language\n    loading: \"lazy\",                  // Lazy load comments\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### How It Works\n\n- **Each blog post** automatically creates a GitHub discussion\n- **Visitors need GitHub accounts** to comment\n- **Comments appear** both on your blog and in GitHub Discussions\n- **You moderate** through GitHub's interface\n- **\"Announcement\" format** prevents random discussion creation\n\n#### Moderation & Control\n\n- **Delete comments** directly in GitHub Discussions\n- **Block users** through GitHub's user management\n- **Lock discussions** to prevent new comments\n- **Pin important comments** to the top\n- **Use GitHub's content policies** for automatic moderation\n\n#### Privacy Considerations\n\nComments are publicly visible and associated with users' GitHub profiles. Consider adding a privacy policy section about comments (see the included Privacy Policy page for reference).\n\n## Content Structure\n\n```\nsrc/content/\n├── posts/                   # Blog posts\n│   ├── attachments/           # Shared post images, audio, or other attachments.\n│   ├── getting-started.md   # File-based post\n│   └── sample-folder-post/  # Folder-based post\n│       ├── index.md         # Main content file\n│       ├── hero-image.jpg   # Post-specific assets\n│       └── diagram.png\n├── pages/                   # Static pages\n│   ├── attachments/           # Shared page images, audio, or other attachments.\n│   ├── about.md\n│   ├── contact.md\n│   └── privacy-policy.md\n├── special/                 # Special pages\n│   ├── home.md             # Homepage blurb content\n│   ├── 404.md              # 404 error page\n│   ├── projects.md         # Projects index page content\n│   └── docs.md             # Docs index page content\n├── projects/                # Featured projects\n│   ├── attachments/           # Shared project images, audio, or other attachments.\n│   └── sample-project/      # Folder-based project\n│       ├── index.md\n│       └── screenshot.png\n├── docs/                    # Documentation\n│   ├── attachments/           # Shared doc images, audio, or other attachments.\n│   └── sample-guide.md      # Documentation files\n└── .obsidian/               # Obsidian vault setup\n    ├── plugins/             # Configured plugins\n    ├── themes/              # Minimal theme\n    └── snippets/            # Custom CSS snippets\n```\n\n## Content Organization\n\n### Special Content Collection\nSpecial index pages are handled by the `special` content collection in `src/content/special/`:\n\n- **`home.md`** - Homepage blurb content\n- **`404.md`** - 404 error page  \n- **`posts.md`** - Posts index page (title, description, H1)\n- **`projects.md`** - Projects index page content\n- **`docs.md`** - Documentation index page content\n\nThese pages have fixed URLs and minimal frontmatter to prevent accidental breakage of core functionality. Most support content below frontmatter, except `posts.md` which only uses frontmatter fields.\n\n### Optional Content Types\n\nYou can globally enable/disable optional content sections in `src/config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\noptionalContentTypes: {\n  projects: true, // Enable projects section\n  docs: true,     // Enable documentation section\n},\n```\n\nWhen disabled, the dynamic index pages redirect to 404, allowing you to create static fallback pages in `src/content/pages/` (e.g., `pages/projects.md`).\n\n### Tags\nTags sync between Obsidian and your blog, creating:\n- Tag pages for related posts\n- Command palette filtering\n- Organized navigation\n\n### Drafts\n- **Development**: All posts visible\n- **Production**: Only published posts\n- Use `draft: true` in frontmatter to hide\n\n## Writing Posts\n\nCreate posts in `src/content/posts/` with this frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"{{title}}\"\ndate: {{date}}\ndescription: \"\"\ntags: []\nimage: \"\"\nimageAlt: \"\"\nimageOG: false\nhideCoverImage: false\ntargetKeyword: \"\"\nhideTOC: false\ndraft: true\n---\n\n## Start with H2 Headings\n\nWrite using markdown with enhanced features.\n\nUse [[wikilinks]] or [markdown links](/posts/post.md) to connect posts.\n\n> [!note] Obsidian Callouts\n> Work exactly like in Obsidian!\n```\n\nSince the post title is hardcoded as H1, your content should start with H2 headings.\n\nYou can also create folder-based posts, as you can see here: [Sample Folder-Based Post](sample-folder-based-post/index.md). The base filename is `index.md` and the parent folder filename serves as the slug of the post.\n\n## Creating Pages \n\nThe About page represents a standard page you can duplicate easily. Its frontmatter looks like this: \n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"{{title}}\"\ndescription: \"\"\nhideTOC: false\nnoIndex: false\n---\n\n## Start with H2 Headings\n\nWrite using markdown with enhanced features.\n```\n\nH1s are hardcoded from the title frontmatter like posts, but pages get a unique `noIndex` property that sets whether or not the page should be indexed in search engines or included on the sitemap. Helpful for pages that you don't want indexed like a thank-you page.\n\n### Other Page Details\n\nThe Contact page has an optional form embedded into it, which leads to the Thank You page when filled out. It's preconfigured to work with Netlify out of the box, you just have to [enable form detection](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/forms/setup/) on your project.\n\nAn optional Privacy Policy page can be edited or removed by deleting it if you don't want it. \n\n`special/home.md` controls what goes on the homepage blurb. Adding content to `special/404.md` will display on any \"not found\" page.\n\n## Creating Projects\n\nCreate projects in `src/content/projects/` to showcase your work. Projects support both single files and folder-based organization:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"{{title}}\"\ndescription: \"Project description\"\ndate: {{date}}\ncategories: [\"Web Development\", \"Open Source\"]\nrepositoryUrl: \"https://github.com/username/repo\"\nprojectUrl: \"https://your-project.com\"\nstatus: \"completed\"  # \"in-progress\" or \"completed\"\nimage: \"cover.jpg\"\nimageAlt: \"Project screenshot\"\nhideCoverImage: false\nhideTOC: false\ndraft: false\nfeatured: true\n---\n```\n\n**Featured flag**: Show on homepage when enabled.\n\n## Creating Documentation\n\nCreate documentation in `src/content/docs/` for guides and references:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"{{title}}\"\ndescription: \"Documentation description\"\ncategory: \"Setup\"  # Optional - creates \"Unsorted\" if missing\norder: 1\nversion: \"1.0.0\"\nlastModified: 2024-01-15\nimage: \"hero.jpg\"\nimageAlt: \"Documentation screenshot\"\nhideCoverImage: false\nhideTOC: false\ndraft: false\nfeatured: true\n---\n```\n\nSort docs within categories by `order` number. Use `featured` to show on homepage when enabled.\n\n## Automatic Aliases & Redirects\n\nWhen you rename a content type (post or page by default, but configurable in settings) in Obsidian, the old filename is automatically stored as an alias. Astro processes these aliases and creates redirect rules, so old URLs continue to work. You don't need to add aliases manually - they appear automatically when you use Obsidian's rename functionality.\n\n## Obsidian Integration\n\n### Using the Included Vault\n\n1. Open `src/content/` in Obsidian\n2. Trust author and enable plugins (Astro Composer, Minimal theme)\n3. Start writing\n\nThe vault provides:\n- **Preconfigured plugins** optimized for this Astro blog\n- **Adjustable theme** for distraction-free writing\n- **Optional CSS snippets** to customize your experience\n- **Custom hotkeys** for accelerating post creation and publishing\n\nRead [the guide](../posts/obsidian-vault-guide.md) for more detailed information.\n\nTo remove Obsidian, simply delete the `.obsidian` folder.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Command Palette\nPress `Ctrl+K` (or custom hotkey) for instant navigation, search, and dark/light mode switching.\n\n### Post Internal Linking & Connections\n- `[[Post Title|Custom Text]]` - wikilinks (posts only)\n- `[Post Title](posts/post-slug.md)` - standard markdown links\n- `[Post Title](/posts/post-slug)` - relative standard markdown links (these work for every content type except for pages*)\n- **Linked mentions** show post connections automatically with collapsible interface\n- **Compact or detailed view** options for linked mentions display\n\n\u003Csmall>*Because standard pages live under the `pages` folder and special pages live under the `special` folder, relative links won't BOTH work in Obsidian as expected to link *and* show up on your blog. If you don't care about it working in Obsidian, you can do something like \u003Ccode>[About](/about])\u003C/code> and it will work as expected on your site.\u003C/small>\n\n### Linking Between Content Types\n\n**Wikilinks** work seamlessly for posts but are limited to the posts collection only. For linking to other content types (pages, projects, docs), use standard markdown links:\n\n- **Posts**: `[[file-name|Post Title]]`, `[Post Title](posts/file-name.md)` or `[Post Title](/posts/file-name)`\n- **Pages**: `[Page Title](file-name.md)` (e.g., `[About](pages/about.md)`\n- **Projects**: `[Project Name](projects/file-name.md)`\n- **Docs**: `[Documentation](docs/file-name.md)`\n\n**Why this limitation?** Wikilinks assume posts for simplicity and to maintain the seamless Obsidian experience. Standard markdown links provide explicit control over which content type you're linking to, preventing confusion when multiple content types might have similar titles.\n\n### Image Optimization\n- **WebP conversion** for performance\n- **Responsive grids** for multiple images\n- **Lazy loading** built-in\n\n### SEO & Performance\n- **Automatic sitemaps** and RSS feeds\n- **Open Graph** meta tags\n- **Optimized for performance and accessibility**\n- **Static generation**\n\n## Deployment\n\n```bash\npnpm build\n```\n\nGenerates a static site ready for any hosting platform with automatic optimization.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues:\n- **Image paths**: Check folder structure in `src/content/posts/attachments/`\n- **Wikilinks**: Ensure target posts exist and are published\n- **Build errors**: Verify frontmatter syntax\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Customize** `src/config.ts`\n2. **Write** your first post\n3. **Explore** [Formatting Reference](formatting-reference.md)\n4. **Set up** Obsidian vault workflow\n5. **Deploy** and share\n\nYour modular Astro blog is ready for your content!","src/content/docs/configuration.md","363d6e71889d646d",{"html":1050,"metadata":1051},"\u003Cp>This comprehensive guide covers everything needed to set up and customize your modular Astro blog, designed for Obsidian users who want to publish content with minimal friction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"prerequisites--setup\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#prerequisites--setup\">Prerequisites &#x26; Setup\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>You’ll need:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Node.js 18+\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>pnpm\u003C/strong> (recommended) or npm\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Basic markdown familiarity\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Obsidian (optional)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"installation\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#installation\">Installation\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Install pnpm\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">npm\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> install\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> -g\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> pnpm\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Install dependencies\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">pnpm\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> install\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Preview\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">pnpm\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> dev\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#6A737D\"> # or pnpm preview\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Available at http://localhost:5000\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#6A737D\"># Build for production\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">pnpm\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> build\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"configuration\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#configuration\">Configuration\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"core-settings\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#core-settings\">Core Settings\u003C/a>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Configure everything in \u003Ccode>src/config.ts\u003C/code>.

It provides automated file renaming, note properties management for post frontmatter, and seamless internal link conversion between Obsidian and Astro formats.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **New Post Dialog**: Automatically prompts for a title when creating new Markdown files, generating kebab-case filenames (e.g., \"My Blog Post\" → `my-blog-post.md`)\n- **Property Standardization**: Updates note properties to match customizable templates while preserving existing frontmatter values\n- **Draft Management**: Optionally adds underscore prefixes to hide drafts from Astro builds\n- **Internal Link Conversion**: Converts Obsidian wikilinks and markdown internal links to Astro-friendly Markdown links\n- **Configurable Workflow**: Customize posts folder, link base path, creation mode, date format, and excluded directories\n- **Rename Post Command**: Easily rename notes by updating the title property and getting automatic kebab-case file/folder updates\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nBuilt with TypeScript and following Obsidian's plugin development best practices, the plugin integrates seamlessly with Obsidian's file system and provides a smooth user experience for content creators.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Content Creators**: Streamline the process of creating and managing blog posts\n- **Astro Developers**: Bridge the gap between Obsidian note-taking and Astro publishing\n- **Technical Writers**: Maintain consistent formatting and file organization\n- **Bloggers**: Focus on content creation rather than file management\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\nThe plugin can be installed directly into Obsidian's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory and configured through Obsidian's settings interface. It supports both file-based and folder-based post structures, making it flexible for different Astro setups.\n\n## Project Status\n\nThis project is in-progress and actively maintained. The latest version includes robust automation features and comprehensive configuration options for various Astro workflows.\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-astro-composer\" class=\"no-styling no-underline\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cbutton class=\"btn btn-primary w-full\">  \n    View Project  \n  \u003C/button>\u003C/a>","src/content/projects/astro-composer.md","dd1943730840b451",{"html":1195,"metadata":1196},"\u003Ch2 id=\"project-overview\">\u003Ca class=\"anchor-link\" aria-label=\"Link to this section\" href=\"#project-overview\">Project Overview\u003C/a>\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Astro Composer is a powerful Obsidian plugin designed to streamline the blogging workflow for Astro static sites.
